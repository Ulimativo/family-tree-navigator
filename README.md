## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A GEDCOM file (`.ged`) of your family tree

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/familytree.git
cd familytree

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see your app running.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized build will be in the `dist/` directory, ready to deploy to any static hosting service.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

The easiest way to deploy Family Tree Navigator is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Build and start the container
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the container
docker-compose down
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Building Docker Image Manually

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t familytree:latest .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name familytree familytree:latest

# View logs
docker logs -f familytree

# Stop and remove container
docker stop familytree
docker rm familytree
```

### Production Deployment

For production deployments, consider:

1. **Using a reverse proxy** (nginx, Traefik, Caddy) for HTTPS termination
2. **Setting appropriate resource limits** in docker-compose.yml
3. **Configuring proper logging** and monitoring
4. **Regular backups** of exported GEDCOM files

Example with Traefik reverse proxy:

```yaml
services:
  familytree:
    image: familytree:latest
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.familytree.rule=Host(`genealogy.yourdomain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.familytree.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.familytree.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
```

### Health Checks

The Docker container includes health checks accessible at:
- `/health` - Returns "healthy" if the service is running

### Environment Variables

Currently, the application runs entirely in the browser and doesn't require environment variables. Future cloud persistence features will add support for Firebase configuration.

## 📖 Usage

1. **Import Your GEDCOM File**
   - Click "Import" in the header
   - Select your `.ged` file
   - Choose "Lightweight" mode for browser-only operation

2. **Explore Your Tree**
   - Navigate the interactive tree visualization
   - Click on individuals to view detailed profiles
   - Use the sidebar to search and filter

3. **Assess Data Quality**
   - Run a quality report to identify issues in your data
   - Apply automatic fixes for common data quality problems
   - Track improvements with the quality score

4. **Export Your Work**
   - Export to GEDCOM 7.0 format (standard)
   - Export to JSON (full project with all metadata)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18.3, Vite 6.4
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with CSS Variables
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Data Model**: GEDCOM 7.0 specification
- **State Management**: React Context API
